================
Sherlock 0.3.0
================

This release focus on fixing critical issues with Robot Framework compatibility and improves core features of Sherlock.

You can install the latest available version by running::

    pip install --upgrade robotframework-sherlock

or to install exactly this version::

    pip install robotframework-sherlock==0.3.0

Loading libraries is now more resilient (#56)
--------------------------------------------

Invalid library imports or missing dependencies does not stop Sherlock execution now. Import errors should be now
displayed in the report::

    Directory: test_data
    ├── Library: Library.py
    │   Import errors:
    │       D:\test.robot: Library 'Library' expected 0 arguments, got 1.
    ├── Library: LibraryWithArgs.py
    │   Import errors:
    │       D:\test.robot: Library 'LibraryWithArgs' expected 1 argument, got 0.

New --pythonpath option to enable searching in extra paths (#46)
----------------------------------------------------------------

New ``--pythonpath`` option was added to allow specifying extra paths to be searched when looking for the test library.
The supported syntax is the same as Robot Framework ``--pythonpath`` syntax.

Sherlock now accepts single file as path argument
-------------------------------------------------

It is now possible to pass single file for Sherlock analysis::

    sherlock test.robot

In such case Sherlock will use file parent directory as a base.

Reports are now dynamically loaded
----------------------------------

<TODO: release notes about rewriting reports to be dynamically loaded, such as Robocop reports>
